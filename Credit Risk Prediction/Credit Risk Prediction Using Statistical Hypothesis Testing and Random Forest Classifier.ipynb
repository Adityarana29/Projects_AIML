        "This project aims to forecast credit risk based on data-driven and statistically proven machine learning methods. The process starts with preprocessing, hypothesis testing, feature selection, and then predictive modeling with Random Forest Classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data provided are important financial and behavioral characteristics like Annual_Income, Monthly_Inhand_Salary, Outstanding_Debt, Num_of_Delayed_Payment, Interest_Rate, and Credit_Utilization_Ratio.\n",
        "Data cleaning was done by handling missing values by median and mode imputation, and outliers were handled using the Interquartile Range (IQR) approach. Numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler, and categorical variables were encoded with Label Encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to verify that the dataset was statistically sound for modeling, Hypothesis Testing was conducted:\n",
        "\n",
        "P-test was applied in order to check for the significance of each feature towards the target variable. Features with p-value < 0.05 were deemed statistically significant, reflecting an important relationship with credit risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "T-test was employed in order to test the mean difference between defaulters and non-defaulters in case of numeric variables like Outstanding_Debt and Credit_Utilization_Ratio, ensuring that these financial metrics significantly vary between risk groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "The understanding obtained through hypothesis testing was used to optimize the feature set prior to machine learning. Outstanding_Debt, Credit_Utilization_Ratio, and Num_of_Delayed_Payment were the important predictors discovered.\n",
        "\n",
        "A Random Forest Classifier was then utilized because of its stability, interpretability, and ability to deal with non-linear complex relationships. It was trained on balanced data gathered via SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to avoid majority class bias.\n",
        "Upon training, the model recorded high Accuracy and ROC-AUC, which means that it was well capable of separating safe and risky borrowers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The chosen evaluation metrics — Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC — were used as they are directly responsible for reducing business risk. A high recall means most defaulters are identified correctly, avoiding possible loan loss, and a high precision eliminates false positives (customers incorrectly marked as risky).\n",
        "This balance has a beneficial business effect, facilitating data-driven loan approvals and better credit scoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Random Forest feature importance analysis and SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) visualization identified that Outstanding_Debt, Num_of_Delayed_Payment, and Credit_Utilization_Ratio were the most significant features influencing the model's decision process.\n",
        "\n",
        "In total, this project effectively marries statistical hypothesis testing and machine learning modeling to provide a credible, explainable, and scalable credit risk prediction solution. The system not only automates credit scoring but also offers transparent decision reasoning — a critical aspect for financial compliance as well as ethical AI."
