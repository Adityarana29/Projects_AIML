# 📊 EMI Prediction

A **Machine Learning based EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) Prediction Application** built with Python.

This project trains a regression model to **predict EMI amounts** based on loan features (like loan amount, interest rate, and tenure). It also includes a **Streamlit app** to interactively predict EMIs from user inputs.

## 💡 Problem Statement

EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is the **fixed monthly payment** a borrower makes to repay a loan.  
This project aims to:

- Use machine learning to **predict EMI values** given:
  - Loan amount
  - Rate of interest
  - Loan tenure  
- Provide a **simple UI using Streamlit** to make predictions.
